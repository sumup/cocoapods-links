# Override of the Lockfile generation to filter out linked pods in favor of their previously
# installed state (e.g. the state reflected from the Podfile). This is somewhat brittle as it
# depends on the format of the Lockfile hash contents. If the format changes, then this will also
# need to be changed. It would be far better to integrate the link filtering elsewhere but this 
# works "for now"
